A pelvic ultrasound scan is a key diagnostic tool used to visualize the organs within the pelvis. This non-invasive imaging technique is vital for assessing the health of pelvic structures such as the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and bladder. Widely used in gynecology and obstetrics, pelvic ultrasounds provide valuable insights into various medical conditions and play a crucial role in early diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of ongoing health issues.

At Butler Medical Imaging, we are committed to delivering top-tier medical imaging services, ensuring that our patients receive accurate diagnoses in a professional and supportive environment.

What is a Pelvic Ultrasound?
A pelvic ultrasound is a medical imaging test that uses high-frequency sound waves to create detailed images of the internal organs in the pelvic region. It is a safe and non-invasive procedure that does not involve radiation, making it ideal for use in various patient populations, including children and pregnant women.

Ultrasound technology operates on the principle of sound wave reflection. When the ultrasound waves encounter tissues of different densities, they bounce back, creating an image on the screen. These images are displayed in black and white and provide a clear view of the pelvic organs.

The scan is conducted by a trained sonographer, who uses an ultrasound machine to capture the images. The sonographer’s expertise is crucial, as much of the diagnostic information is gathered during the real-time examination. These images are stored digitally or printed for review by the healthcare provider.

How is a Pelvic Ultrasound Performed?
There are two primary methods for performing a pelvic ultrasound scan: transabdominal and transvaginal. Both approaches offer different perspectives and are chosen based on the specific clinical need.

1. Transabdominal Ultrasound

A transabdominal ultrasound is the more common and less invasive approach. It involves placing the ultrasound transducer on the outside of the abdomen to get a broad view of the pelvic organs. This type of scan requires the patient to have a full bladder. The full bladder acts as a window, helping to push the bowel out of the way and providing a clearer image of the uterus, ovaries, and other structures.

Preparation for a transabdominal scan includes drinking about a litre of water 30 to 60 minutes before the scan and not emptying the bladder until after the procedure. During the scan, the sonographer moves the ultrasound probe across the lower abdomen to obtain images.

2. Transvaginal Ultrasound

A transvaginal ultrasound is performed by inserting a thin ultrasound probe into the vagina. This method allows the sonographer to obtain more detailed images of the pelvic organs, as the probe is closer to the structures being examined. The procedure is typically done with the bladder empty and often follows a transabdominal scan for more comprehensive results.

Why Would You Need a Pelvic Ultrasound?
A pelvic ultrasound is used for various diagnostic purposes and is commonly performed for the following reasons:

1. Pregnancy

Pelvic ultrasounds are a routine part of prenatal care. They help confirm pregnancy, estimate gestational age, and assess the health and development of the fetus. In early pregnancy, ultrasound is used to detect the fetus's heartbeat and estimate the due date.

Later in pregnancy, ultrasounds can be used to monitor fetal growth, detect any anatomical abnormalities, and check the position of the placenta. An anatomy scan around 18-20 weeks helps to examine the fetus's organs and structures, ensuring healthy development.

2. Pelvic or Abdominal Pain

A pelvic ultrasound is often ordered to investigate the cause of pelvic or lower abdominal pain in women. The scan can help identify issues such as ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, or endometriosis. These conditions often cause pain, bloating, or menstrual irregularities and can be effectively evaluated using ultrasound imaging.

3. Gynecological Health

Pelvic ultrasounds play a crucial role in assessing gynecological health, especially for women experiencing irregular menstrual cycles, infertility, or abnormal bleeding. Ultrasound can help evaluate the health of the uterus and ovaries, identifying any structural abnormalities that may be causing these symptoms.

4. Bladder and Urinary Health

Pelvic ultrasounds can also be used to examine the bladder and identify issues like bladder stones or urinary tract infections. The scan provides a clear view of the bladder’s structure and can help diagnose underlying problems that may be causing urinary symptoms such as frequent urination or pain during urination.

Test Results Explained
After a pelvic ultrasound, the images and findings are analyzed by a radiologist or doctor. The sonographer may provide some preliminary information during the scan, but the final interpretation is given by the referring healthcare provider.

Normal results indicate that the pelvic organs, including the uterus, ovaries, and bladder, appear healthy and functioning properly. In cases where an abnormality is detected, such as ovarian cysts, fibroids, or other structural issues, further testing or treatment may be recommended.
